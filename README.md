# pytorch_MINERVA
This is the code for the paper [Go for a Walk and Arrive at the Answer - Reasoning over Paths in Knowledge Bases using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05851) in pytorch version.

I try to reproduce the model with pytorch and use WN18RR for testing. But I cannot achieve the same performance as the tensorflow version.

It will be very helpful if someone use my code and find why my implementation is worse than the original version or to provide another pytorch implementation with better performance. 

The tensorflow version provided by the author is located at https://github.com/shehzaadzd/MINERVA.



## Quick start

The following command starts our model. You can view main.py for changing parameters.

```
python src/main.py
```

## Evaluation



## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Numpy 
- pytorch 1.0
